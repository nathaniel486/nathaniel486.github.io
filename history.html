					<h1>New Castle's History</h1>
					<p>
						New Castle was originally settled by the Dutch West India Company in 1651 and was called Fort Casimir.  But in 1654 Sweden seized the land and changed the name to 
						Fort Trinity.  The following year The Netherlands conquered the entire New Sweden Colony and rechristened the fort Nieuw-Amstel (New Amstel).  Though the colony 
						under the Dutch remained a semi-autonomous unit.  As the settlement grew Dutch authorities laid out a grid of streets and established the town common (The “Green”) 
						which continues to this day.
						<br><br>
						In 1664 the entire Dutch colony was seized by the British during the second Anglo-Dutch War and changed the name one last time to New Castle.  It was then granted 
						to William Penn in 1680 by the Duke of York by livery of seisin and was also Penn’s landing place in the new world.  This transfer to Penn was contested by Lord 
						Baltimore and the boundary dispute was not resolved until the survey conducted by Mason and Dixon which is now used as the unofficial boundary between the north and 
						the south.
						<br><br>
						The spire atop the Court House, Delaware’s Colonial capitol and the first state house, was used as the center of the Twelve-Mile Circle forming the northern 
						boundary of Delaware between Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  The Delaware River lies within this radius to the low water mark on the opposite shore also belongs to 
						Delaware.  The Delaware Memorial Bridge, which crosses the river and connects Delaware and New Jersey was constructed entirely by Delaware with no financial 
						participation from New Jersey.
						<br><br>
						After Penn gained the rights to the land, the Dutch English and Swedish people grew uncomfortable and angry with the conservative Quakers, so Delaware was granted 
						it’s own separate legislature in 1702, and became one of the 13 colonies in 1704.  Many smaller houses were torn down during this time and replaced as the town grew.  In February 1777 John McKinley was Elected the first President of Delaware (a title later renamed to Governor).  During the Revolution, the government elected to move it’s functions from New Castle to Dover which pleased the representatives from Kent and Sussex County.
