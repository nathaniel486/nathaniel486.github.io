								<h3>The Cobblestone Road</h3><br>
								<br>
								The cobblestone road, located on Market st in the City of New Castle between the Courthouse and the town hall is the only original
								stone road in the state.  Driving down this road can be fun, but is also really bumpy.  During Driver's Ed class they made us drive down 
								this road, and it wasn't exactly a pleasant experience for novice drivers.  My parents wanted to drive down this road after their wedding 
								in a horse drawn carriage, but were disappointed to discover the Art on the Green festival was taking place that day and had the road closed.

								<h3>George Read II's House</h3>
								<br><br>
								George Read II’s Home located at 42 The Strand was built next to his Father’s house where he resided most of his life including when he served in the 
								Continental Congress, was constructed between 1798 and 1803 and is around 14,000 Sq. ft and has a total of 22 rooms.  
								<br><br>
								The Read house has been owned by two other families, but in 1975 the Lairds, the last family to own the house, donated the property along with it’s roughly 2
								acres of gardens to the Delaware Historical Society where it is now a museum.  Most of the rooms in the house have been renovated to what they probably would 
								have looked like when the house was originally constructed.  They even did chemical testing on the walls to match what the original colors of the walls were.
